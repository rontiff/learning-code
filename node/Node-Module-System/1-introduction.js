    // Exmaple: a waitress can serve 2 table at the same time. no need to wait the kitchen prepare the food for table1 first. 
    // single thread handle all request.
    // only build for data intensive and real time application

    // blocking Synchronous    
    //example: a waitress take the order from table1, wait at kitchen until food is ready and serve table1. after that go to table2.
    //the thread only serve one client. new client need to wait. Or add more hardware.
